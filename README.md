# Fail Source: Find the source of your failures on Salesforce

## Description

Right now this project allows you to scan your recent e-mails (Gmail only at the moment) and assigns sentiment ratings.

If the sender of the e-mail is in your Salesforce leads, then it will assign them an aggregate sentiment rating.


## How to Use

1. Clone the repo.
2. Have AWS credentials and know the pricing for Comprehend sentiment analysis.
3. Enable Gmail API and create and download an OAuth credentials file.
4. Have a Salesforce account with third party API access enabled and place credentials, including security token, into `.env` file.
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
6. Run `python src/utils.py` to create the custom sentiment rating field in Salesforce.
7. Enable field visibility for the custom sentiment rating field in Salesforce.
8. Run `python main.py` to run the main program.
9. ???
10. Profit.


## Future Plans

Still deciding... ðŸ¤”...

Definitely would like to make that one step of enabling field visibility in Salesforce programmatic...

And maybe some kind of simple frontend...?
